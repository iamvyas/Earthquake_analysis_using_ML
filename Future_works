Status:
The earthquake analysis model is trained using the Random forest algorithm projected with an accuracy over 70 %

Future work:
 Technical aspect:
  One concern about the technical aspect is to improve its accuracy to much optimum levels
  this can be done using convolutional neural networks, convolutional neural network acts as 
  better options for scenarios with larger dataset features
 
 Application aspect:
  Aplication aspect requires more of composition and structural knowledge of buildings that
  can withstand the earth quake of particular scale of impact.
  
  Our current objective helps us to find the relation between impact and physical features of
  buildings like foundation type,foundation area etc.This helps us to have a basic level of 
  understanding on how buildings aare being affected on each scale of impact.
  
  This should be further brought to study the compositional and structural aspect of building
  under this dataset to help further to understand the structural properties which affects the
  buildings
  
  understanding this property can help us to push the advantages of building houses that can
  withstand earthquake impact in a better scale
